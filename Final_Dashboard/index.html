  <p>South-East Asia includes the following countries:
  Vietnam &#127483&#127475, Laos &#127473&#127462, Thailand &#127481&#127469,
   Singapore &#127480&#127468, Myanmar &#127474&#127474, Brunei &#127463&#127475,
   Malaysia &#127474&#127486, Indonesia &#127470&#127465, Cambodia &#127472&#127469,
   Timor-Leste &#127481&#127473, Philippines &#127477&#127469</p>

  <p> From the lollipop chart on the left, we can see that the population densities
  of South-East Asia countries will increase gradually from 2025 to 2045. 
  </p>

  <p>
  South-East Asia will have the highest population density in 2045 which has been highlighted 
  with a darker shade of purple.

<div class="bar_chart_2_description">
 <p> The median age of South-East Asia countries will increase from 31.8 to 37.2,
 which is considered relatively high from the year 2025 to 2045. 
 </p>
 <p> The increase can be said to be rather gradual as the median age still falls 
  within the range of 30 to 40.

<div class="line_chart_description">
 <p> From the above line chart, we are able to conclude that Philippines 
 has the highest population density among all the other ASEAN countries,
 which is within the range of 348 to 368 p/km2. It also increased gradually 
 throughout the years from 2016 to 2020.   
 </p>

 <p> On the other hand, Laos has the least population density among the ASEAN countries, 
which ranges from 30 to 32. From the line chart, we can see that Laos' 
population density did not change much across the years however it did increase
very minimally.
</p>

<p> The population densities for Singapore across the years are not visible on the
line chart because the population densities are too large compared to other
population densities.
